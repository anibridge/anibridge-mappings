# AniBridge Mappings

AniBridge Mappings is an autogenerated dataset that links anime entries across major media providers. It is primarily designed for the [AniBridge](https://anibridge.eliasbenb.dev) project to drive cross-database matching and episode sync, but it can be consumed by any tooling that needs consistent ID and episode mappings.

The mapping payload is generated by a Python pipeline that merges multiple trusted sources, applies curated overrides, validates episode ranges, and emits a serialization of the [mappings schema](#mappings-schema).

_A huge thank you to the primary mappings maintainer, [@LuceoEtzio](https://github.com/LuceoEtzio), for contributing over **4,000** mapping edits!_ ❤️

## Key Features

- **Multi-source aggregation**: Combines ID and episode data from multiple upstream projects.
- **Episode range mapping**: Supports explicit ranges, open-ended ranges, and ratio-based mappings between providers.
- **Manual overrides**: Curated edits are applied on top of automated sources.
- **Metadata-informed validation**: Episode counts from metadata providers are used to validate and prune invalid ranges and infer missing mappings.
- **Compressed outputs**: Supports minified and zstd-compressed payloads for efficient storage and transfer.

## How It Works

1. **Fetch sources**: Download [upstream datasets](#data-sources) and metadata feeds.
2. **Build ID graph**: Collect cross-database ID links from sources.
3. **Collect metadata**: Fetch relevant metadata (episode counts, durations, season info, etc.) from sources.
4. **Build episode graph**: Normalize and merge episode mappings from all sources.
5. **Infer mappings**: Use techniques like transitive closure and metadata alignment to infer missing episode mappings.
6. **Apply edits**: Overlay mapping overrides from [mappings.edits.yaml](mappings.edits.yaml) onto the aggregated data.
7. **Validate & prune**: Validate episode ranges against metadata and remove invalid, overlapping, or inconsistent mappings.
8. **Emit schema**: Serialize to the [mappings.schema.json](mappings.schema.json) format.

## Mappings Schema

_For the purposes of this README, we will only cover the subset of the schema that is relevant to this pipeline. To read about the full extent of the schema when used with [AniBridge](https://anibridge.eliasbenb.dev), see the [custom mapping docs](https://anibridge.eliasbenb.dev/mappings/custom-mappings/)_

[mappings.schema.json](./mappings.schema.json)

The output is a JSON object where each key is a **source descriptor** and each value is a map of **target descriptors**. Descriptors use the format:

```
provider:id[:scope]
```

- `provider`: one of `anidb`, `anilist`, `mal`, `imdb_movie`, `imdb_show`, `tmdb_show`, `tmdb_movie`, `tvdb_show`.
- `id`: the provider-specific identifier (e.g. AniDB ID `1234` or TMDB ID `tt1234567`).
- `scope`: is optional and used to denote some type of subsetting. For the purposes of this dataset, they will be used to denote a season (e.g. `s0`, `s1`, etc). Certain providers may not use scopes such as AniList and MAL.

Each target descriptor maps source episode ranges to target ranges:

```jsonc
{
  "anidb:1:s0": {
    "tvdb_show:2:s0": {}, // from anidb id 1, season 0 to tvdb id 2, season 0
    "tmdb_show:3:s1": {}, // from anidb id 1, season 0 to tmdb id 3, season 1
  },
  "mal:4": {
    "tmdb_show:5:s0": {}, // from mal id 4 (no scope) to tmdb id 5, season 0
  },
}
```

The key, value of each target descriptor is a map where keys denote a source range and values denote the corresponding target range. For the purposes of this dataset, keys and values will define episode ranges. Ranges use the format:

```
x[-y][|ratio][,x2[-y2][|ratio2]...]
```

- `x`: starting episode number (1-based).
- `y`: optional ending episode number (inclusive). If omitted, the range is open-ended.
- `ratio`: optional ratio indicating the 'weight' of each episode in a range. A positive ratio `n` indicates each episode spans `n` episodes in the opposing range. A negative ratio `-n` indicates each episode spans `1/n` episodes in the opposing range.
- Multiple ranges can be comma-separated to denote non-contiguous mappings. _Note: non-contiguous ranges are only supported on the target side._

```jsonc
{
  "anidb:5:s1": {
    "tvdb_show:6:s0": {
      "1-12": "1-12", // source episodes 1-12 map to target episodes 1-12
      "14-": "13-", // source episodes 14 and onward map to target episodes 13 and onward
    },
    "anilist:7": {
      "1-12": "1-6,8-13", // source episodes 1-12 map to target episodes 1-6 and 8-13 (skipping 7)
      "13-": "14-|2", // source episodes 13 and onward map to target episodes 14 and onward at double granularity
    },
  },
}
```

## Manual Edits

Mapping overrides live in [mappings.edits.yaml](mappings.edits.yaml). The format mirrors the schema structure: a source descriptor maps to target descriptors,
which in turn map source ranges to target ranges.

Example:

```yaml
anilist:12345: # Some comment about this mapping
	tvdb_show:98765:s1:
		"1-12": "1-12"
	tmdb_show:54321:s1:
		"1-12": "1-12"
```

When the pipeline runs, it removes any existing mappings between the specified source and target scopes and replaces them with your entries.

## Running the Pipeline

The CLI entrypoint is [main.py](main.py). Typical usage:

```bash
uv run ./main.py
```

Options:

- `--out`: output file path (default: `data/out/mappings.json`)
- `--schema-version`: override the schema version in `$meta`
- `--edits`: path to the edits file (default: `mappings.edits.yaml`)
- `--compress`: emit minified and zstd-compressed outputs to `data/out/`
- `--stats`: emit `stats.json` to `data/out/`
- `--log-level`: set logging verbosity (default: `INFO`)

_Note: TMDB metadata fetching requires a bearer token set in a `TMDB_API_KEY` environment variable (v4 API token). Without it, TMDB metadata will be skipped._

## Contributing

The best way to contribute is by fixing or adding mappings in [mappings.edits.yaml](mappings.edits.yaml). If you need to reference why a mapping was changed, include a comment inside the mapping entry (not at the root level), so the formatter can preserve it.
